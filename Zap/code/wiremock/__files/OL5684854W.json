{"description": "Every advanced society in the galaxy relies on the technology of the Protheans, an ancient species that vanished fifty thousand years ago. After discovering a cache of Prothean technology on Mars in 2148, humanity is spreading to the stars; the newest interstellar species, struggling to carve out its place in the greater galactic community.\r\n\r\nOn the edge of colonized space, ship commander and Alliance war hero David Anderson investigates the remains of a top secret military research station; smoking ruins littered with bodies and unanswered questions. Who attacked this post and for what purpose? And where is Kahlee Sanders, the young scientist who mysteriously vanished from the base\u2013hours before her colleagues were slaughtered?\r\n\r\nSanders is now the prime suspect, but finding her creates more problems for Anderson than it solves. Partnered with a rogue alien agent he can\u2019t trust and pursued by an assassin he can\u2019t escape, Anderson battles impossible odds on uncharted worlds to uncover a sinister conspiracy . . . one he won\u2019t live to tell about.
