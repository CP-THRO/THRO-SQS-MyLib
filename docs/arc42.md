## 1. Introduction And Goals

## 1.1 Purpose

MyLib is a personal library management system allowing users to search for books via the OpenLibrary API and manage a private collection. Users can:

- Search for books
- View book details (cover, title, authors, description, publish date, ISBNs, average rating by all users in the system)
- Add books to a personal library or wishlist
- Transfer books directly from wishlist to library
- Assign personal ratings (1â€“5) to books in the library
- Manage reading status (unread, currently reading, already read)
- View an aggregated overview of books owned amd wished for by all users (anonymized)

MyLib exposes public endpoints for searching and viewing book details, and secured endpoints for user-specific operations.

| High     | Security                               | All user-specific operations secured (authentication, authorization). |
| High     | Resilience                             | Fault-tolerant integration with OpenLibrary API.                  |
| High     | Maintainability                        | Modular architecture; clean code without static analysis issues. |
| Medium   | Performance                            | Reasonably fast response times for book searches and user operations. |
| Medium   | Usability                              | Simple and intuitive user interface.                             |

## 2. Constraints

Due to the requirements given by the lecuturer, the project has the following constraints:re

- Programming languages allowed:
  - Python
  - TypeScript
  - Java
  - C#
- Must provide:
  - At least one publicly accessible endpoint
  - At least one secured endpoint
  - Three-layer architecture:
    - Frontend
    - Backend
    - Persistence layer
- Backend must integrate with at least one external service
- Must use GitHub for source code and version management
- Must GitHub Actions for pipelines

This project was developed under time pressure due to delays in my bachelors thesis.
