# MyLib Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **MyLib**, a personal library management system.


## About MyLib

MyLib is a web application developed as part of the **Software Quality Assurance (Software-Qualit√§tssicherung - SQS) course at TH Rosenheim** by **Christoph Pircher**.

MyLib allows users to:

- Search for books using the OpenLibrary API
- View book details including covers, authors, descriptions, and ratings
- Create a personal library and wishlist
- Manage personal ratings and reading status for books
- See an anonymized overview of books owned and wished for by all users

The backend is implemented with **Spring Boot**, and the frontend uses **Vue.js** and **Bootstrap**. Data is stored in **PostgreSQL**, and the entire application runs in Docker containers.
